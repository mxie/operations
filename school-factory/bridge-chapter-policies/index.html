<p>School Factory is a non-profit organization whose mission is to support communities and spaces that transform education, and that is exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue code (IRC). As a program of School Factory, Bridge Foundry and its sub-organizations must conduct activities and spend money only in support of its mission within IRS guidelines.</p>
<p>Bridge Foundry Mission: Empower people with technology through teaching and facilitating access, enlarging the community of people who give back and teach others.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bridge Foundry (“Foundry”) is the support team for all the Bridges and their Chapters and free-form volunteer efforts.  The Foundry is led by a Program Director and representative board.</li>
<li>Bridge, in this document refers to a self-governing Bridge with its own board.  Each bridge focuses on a specific technology, or set of technologies, and shares open source curriculum and program materials across geographies. Bridge leaders may add new Chapters and Chapter leaders. Sometimes people organize a single event or initiative for a new technology, independent of a Bridge and that is fine.</li>
<li>Chapter: a regional, technology-specific group which has held at least one event.  Each Chapter belongs to a Bridge.  An active Chapter has one or more leaders, who might do fundraising and can approve expenses if the Chapter has a budget. Chapter leaders can also have the ability to approve or edit events for their chapter and add/remove leaders for their chapter.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="operations">Operations</h2>
<p>Bridge Foundry is run by a small operations team, including a part time Operations Manager (operations@bridgefoundry.org) with accounting, legal, and advisory support from School Factory.</p>
<p>New Bridges can be created by anyone who wants to offer programs that are aligned with our mission.  For more detail see <a href="http://bridgefoundry.org/doc/bridge-building.html">how to make a bridge</a>.</p>
<h2 id="event-organizing">Event Organizing</h2>
<p>We have an open source event registration system, <a href="https://www.bridgetroll.org/">Bridge Troll</a>, which has been developed by RailsBridge volunteers. While many leaders use Meetup or EventBrite to organize events, we developed Bridge Troll as a way to effectively manage separate lists of volunteers and students, allowing for ongoing profiles and tracking of history, which is not well-supported by other online tools.  We strongly encourage all volunteers who are organizing events to use Bridge Troll.  Please file an <a href="https://github.com/railsbridge/bridge_troll/issues">issue</a> or join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bridge-troll">mailing list</a> if you have feedback.  To learn more about it, please check out the <a href="https://github.com/railsbridge/bridge_troll/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>
<h2 id="finance">Finance</h2>
<h3 id="directing-funds">Directing Funds</h3>
<p>It is our policy that the group (Foundry, Bridge or Chapter) that raises funds, gets to direct how the funds are spent; however, donations must be provided without restriction to Bridge Foundry, so as to streamline our internal processes (more on that below). We often communicate our intentions to sponsors and report on our progress, but it is important that those reports are not a formal commitment to allocate an exact amount of money to a specific program.  This allows the leadership of the Foundry, Bridge or Chapter the flexibility to reallocate funds as needed.</p>
<p>When volunteers or staff raise funds via Bridge Foundry, they will associate the donation(s) with a specific Workshop, Chapter, Bridge, or Bridge Foundry.  All funds must be spent only on educational and charitable activities that are aligned with our mission. All expenses must be approved by a Workshop or Chapter leader, a Bridge board member, or a designated volunteer or staff person.  </p>
<h3 id="allowed-expenses">Allowed Expenses</h3>
<p>Any Bridge or Chapter will utilize funds only for charitable and educational activities consistent with our tax-exempt status described above. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Bridge will not intervene in any election or support or oppose any political party or candidate for public office, or engage in any lobbying not permitted by section 501(c)(3) of the IRC, or, if applicable, IRC 501§§(h) and 4911. Bridges or Chapters will not endorse political candidates or parties.</p>
<h3 id="financial-guidance">Financial Guidance</h3>
<p>The Finance Committee is composed of staff and volunteers.  Current members of the Finance Committee are: Sarah Allen,
Diana Luepke (School Factory Operations), Mary Jenn (Bridge Foundry Operations) and Carlisia Campos.</p>
<p>Help needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>review grant proposals from volunteer</li>
<li>coordination with fundraising committee for local chapter support</li>
<li>assistance with program projected expenses and financial planning for new initiatives</li>
<li>periodic review of policies and editing for clarification</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to join our volunteer team, please email finance@bridgefoundry.org</p>
