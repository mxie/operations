The Corporation's staff is pleased to meet with prospective donors and their advisors to explore their interests, the needs of the Corporation, the various gift options and the related tax consequences. The Corporation will advise all donors to seek their own tax and legal counsel and will in no event render tax, legal or financial advice. As a general rule, current gifts are encouraged in favor of deferred gifts. Similarly, the Corporation encourages unrestricted gifts, but recognizes the importance of restrictions to some donors in ensuring that their particular interests are supported or funded. Restricted gifts are therefore welcome, but only at specified funding levels and with the express understanding that the Corporation may use the funds as it deems appropriate if the donor's particular interest is no longer viable. Note: The Corporation does not offer donor advised funds. Donor restrictions, if any, must be made at the time the gift is made and must be limited to a particular use or activity conducted by the Corporation. II. CURRENT GIFT OPTIONS A. Cash Any amount is encouraged and welcome. While unrestricted contributions are encouraged, any donor has the option to restrict some or all of his or her gift to a specific program or use when the gift exceeds $50,000.00.

Types of Donors Most Chapters and Communities raise funds for their activities primarily via corporate sponsorships. Once your group has a Volunteer Fundraiser signed up, they can reach out to companies in your area who might be interested in supporting your activities. Volunteer Fundraisers can also raise money from individual donors if desired. Methods of Payment Regardless of whether you are receiving donations from a company or an individual, our options for accepting payments are the same. Most of the time the Volunteer Fundraiser will submit an invoice request and we will send the donor an invoice that can include payment options of check, ACH bank transfer, and credit card.

Crowdfunding & Other Methods If you want to raise or process donations in any method different from those explicitly outlined in this operations guide, including crowdfunding, please contact us at finance@bridgefoundry.org and we will explore options with you.

In order to receive payment from a sponsor, please complete the Bridge Foundry Invoice Request Form . An electronic invoice will be sent to the recipient's email address you specified in the request form within a week at the most (usually within a couple of business days). You will know when it goes out, because we cc you on the email as well. If you don't see the invoice go out within a few days, feel free to follow up with us at finance@bridgefoundry.org. Please complete one form for each sponsor/payment. Payment Methods The sponsor may pay by any of the following methods once they receive the invoice: Check (default option; no fee) ACH (integrated into invoice if requested; flat 50\u00a2 fee) Credit card (integrated into invoice if requested; 3.40% + 25\u00a2 fee) PayPal (not preferred but an option if they ask; your group absorbs 2.2% + 30\u00a2 fee) When you fill out the Invoice Request Form, you can select which payment options you want activated on the invoice. In order to maximize your donation, we recommend either leaving the credit option off or asking them if they will consider covering the fees. Many sponsors prefer the convenience of credit card transactions and are happy to pay a few dollars more to cover the transaction fee, in which case we can include that as an additional line item on the invoice. Payment Follow Up Once you submit an invoice request, we will follow up to ensure payment comes through. After about a month with no payment, we remind the sponsor about paying After about 2 months with no payment, we will ask you to follow up with the sponsor directly If you are curious about the status of the payment at any time, you can click on the original emailed invoice (it will be marked \"Paid\" in big letters if we have received payment). If a donor check or payment is not received prior to an upcoming workshop, don\u2019t worry! We will advance funds from the Bridge Foundry general fund to cover your expenses until we receive payment. Paperwork Sometimes sponsors want us to fill out special vendor paperwork, get set up in their ACH system, provide a W9, or prove our 501c3 status.

We ask that chapters and communities within our network explain this to donors appropriately. What is an unrestricted donation? \"Unrestricted\" funds are donations a nonprofit may use for any purpose. When donations are made to Bridge Foundry for a specific program, chapter, community, or purpose, we do set aside those funds for the intended purpose. We communicate up front with donors that the funds are unrestricted just in case funds need to be reallocated down the road. If I donate money to support a specific event or community, why would it go elsewhere? We have a very small part-time staff and all of our work is accomplished by volunteers, student participants and independent communities who use our open source materials. When a volunteer raises funds with the goal of enabling a local community, we have processes in place to support that specific local community using those funds as much as possible; however, we do not formally restrict those funds to allow for flexibility if more money is raised than needed for a specific event (so volunteers can use it for a future event), for those rare cases where an active local volunteer might move away with no successor, or for other circumstances that make it impractical for us to spend funds as originally designated. There may be a very active volunteer elsewhere who could make a big impact with those funds, and if that ever were to happen, then we would want you to support that without needing to contact you to discuss the change. Our goal is to be 100% transparent, and all of our finances are open ; however, tracking and reporting all these details for a very unlikely event doesn\u2019t seem a great use of our resources.

These are grants that don't have dedicated funding set aside for them via the efforts of a Volunteer Fundraiser working with the group. As soon as you think you may need funds, please apply! Since some parts of the funding process can take a week or more, it's better to start working on funding earlier in your event planning than in the last few weeks. We can always convert the grant from a Seed Fund Grant to a Funded Grant if you end up being successful in raising sponsorship money after all. Apply for a Seed Fund Grant To apply for the grant, just fill out this Application Form . Select \"We are seeking a seed fund grant\" since you don't have funds in place to cover the cost. Approval Process Grant applications are evaluated within a week of submission, usually a few days. We look to see if the application meets the following standard criteria: * Budget is within normal parameters for the region * Expenses are for normal recommended workshop things; see our approved expenses policy * Application is submitted by an organizer who is either a known and experienced organizer, or who has been approved by a known chapter leader or experienced volunteer organizer. If you're not sure what that means for you, get in touch with us at finance@bridgefoundry.org. If funds are available, first-time grant applications for Bridge workshops that meet the standard criteria by an approved organizer are approved without further evaluation. We welcome innovative ideas. Don't be deterred if your plan is not typical -- all of our work started with a-typical ideas. If you have an idea that does not conform to the standard criteria, we will be happy to discuss it with you and consider a grant. It may take us slightly longer in that case to make a decision and approve or deny the application. If grant applications exceed current funding, Bridge Foundry staff will assess impact and make a decision or raise additional funds to cover all applications. Receiving & Using Funds Once the grant is approved, there are two ways to make use of the funds: 1. Reimbursement (preferred): Make the purchases and submit your receipts for reimbursement. Expensify deposits the reimbursement straight into your bank account. 2. Direct pay : For those who can't afford to get reimbursed, we can arrange to pay for expenses directly by processing payment for an invoice from them or calling them with credit card information. This option requires some lead time to make arrangements. Learn more about spending the money under Using Funds . Important: Review the receipt requirements before you start making purchases. Post-Event When you do receive funding from Bridge Foundry's seed fund, we ask that you simply write a short blog post after your event on the Bridge Foundry blog about how the grant helped you and your community hold the workshop and the difference it has made.

Most Bridges follow the original RailsBridge \u201cviral workshop\u201d model with open source curriculum and in-person events. Students become TAs become Teachers. The best teachers are those who have learned most recently, and have a passion for giving back to a community that fostered their own development. Companies benefit when we expand the talent pool, and their staff who volunteer at workshops become more expert through teaching and improving their leadership and communication skills. Bridge leaders are encouraged to innovate with new techniques for creating diverse and inclusive communities, for example, the GoBridge podcast and Slack community. When curricula are developed for a programming language or subject matter area or volunteers start to engage in this work, we traditionally choose a name that includes the word \u201cBridge.\u201d For example, our curriculum for Ruby on Rails is referred to as \u201cRailsBridge.\u201d Naming note: so we can explore IP protections and in the future accept checks for any Bridge, we consider all the Bridge names are technically synonymous with Bridge Foundry. Overview The current structure of our organization is illustrated in Bridge Foundry Operations Overview The officers and board of directors are identified in our corporate docs Roles Volunteer Bridge Leader Separate from the creation and availability of curricula for a particular technology, volunteers may opt to create a Bridge leadership board, so they may promote use of a particular curriculum and provide deeper guidance and support for curriculum users. Bridge Leaders complete our Volunteer Agreement , which references specific Bridge Leader Policies . Independent Community Most of the groups we work with are Independent Communities (usually referred to as \u201cCommunities\u201d for short). Communities use a Bridge curriculum, agree to our Workshop Guidelines, and align themselves publicly with Bridge Foundry by using one of our official names (like RailsBridge, ClojureBridge, etc). They are not legally part of Bridge Foundry, Inc. but we support them in a variety of ways, as requested, including guidance, grants, and access to our online resources. Chapter Chapters have a lot in common with Communities. They agree to our Workshop Guidelines and use a version of one of our official names. They can access the same resources like fundraising advice and use of Bridge Troll . They also have some additional benefits: Access to finance infrastructure, such as Pex cards and online donation processing through their website Access to the benefits of being part of a nonprofit organization, which can include things like discounts and access to some in-kind gifts In the future, active Bridge Foundry Chapters will also be covered by our liability insurance, in the unlikely event that there\u2019s some kind of legal action. In order to become a Chapter, groups will: Have one or more leaders who make a commitment to lead the chapter (for at least one year) Have some track record with the organization and plan to hold at least 2 events in the upcoming year Complete our Volunteer Agreement Meet with their Bridge leader and/or a volunteer mentor once a year to share knowledge about successes and challenges Chapters typically have one or more volunteer fundraisers (see below). Chapter Leaders complete our Volunteer Agreement , which references specific Chapter Leader Policies . Program Sometimes we support groups that don\u2019t follow the Bridge model for engaging underrepresented communities, but are clearly mission aligned. Women Who Go is an example of this type of program currently; Test First Teaching and the Teaching Kids initiative are past programs that are not currently active. While their needs are slightly different, programs like these generally follow our operational guidelines for fundraising and expenses, as well as following our Code of Conduct or approved equivalent. They may also have an opportunity to access the additional resources available for Chapters (as a \u201cProgram\u201d) provided that they have active leadership in place and we have capacity to support them. Leaders of Programs that operate as a legal part of Bridge Foundry, Inc. (similar to Chapters) complete our Volunteer Agreement , which references specific Program Leader Policies . Volunteer Fundraiser Volunteer fundraisers are just what they sound like: individuals can help raise money generally for Bridge Foundry, or specifically for a Community, Chapter, Program, or Bridge. The main caveat is that all funds raised technically need to be unrestricted funds to allow the organization to act when volunteers become inactive. (\u201cUnrestricted\u201d is a technical term in the fundraising world that indicates the money can be used generally to support our mission, rather than needing to track and report on funds allocated and spent for very specific purposes.) Volunteer Fundraisers complete our Volunteer Agreement , which references specific fundraising policies . Common Questions International groups We have inspired a global movement, with workshops using Bridge curriculum offered around the world. Yet there are logistical limits to the activities our formal US corporation can directly pursue in other countries. At this time, we are not able to legally operate in other countries, so international groups cannot become Chapters. We also cannot provide grants to individuals in other countries, so international Communities aren\u2019t currently eligible for financial grants. We do have communities with relationships with nonprofits in other countries, and we\u2019re learning about whether we could extend those relationships to help more Communities internationally. What international groups CAN do is: * Operate as an Independent Community and make use of open source and open online service we provide * If you are interested in further operational support outside of the US, please review open issues and if there is not one for your country, file a new issue How funding works for these roles Chapters that have a Volunteer Fundraiser are able to raise funds directly for their activities and spend those funds using a few different methods. See more detail in the Chapter Leader Policies. Communities may also raise funds for their activities via a Volunteer Fundraiser, and they need to apply for a grant to receive those funds. We will approve the grant as long as those raised funds are available and both the application and the Community follow our policies. Communities may apply for a grant for multiple workshops to reduce the administrative work of multiple applications. Grants are usually paid out as reimbursements for expenses, but having Bridge Foundry pay vendors directly is also an option. We also provide grants to both Chapters and Communities that are having trouble locating a sponsor. These grants are approved on a first-come basis. They are always approved as long as we have funds available and the application meets well-documented guidelines, where innovation is allowed and encouraged with a review process. To really scale, we rely on local fundraising, so we\u2019re also looking at creating a local fundraising kit so we can encourage volunteers in each region to develop these skills and relationships.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"roles/#background","text":"The Bridge model is one of intentionally creating a community of practice, where students, expert developers, community leaders, companies and entrepreneurs collaborate and learn together.

Bridge leaders may promote use of a particular curriculum, provide deeper guidance and support for people who teach with and learn from the open source curriculum and other materials, and engage in other activities that foster community engagement in learning about their technology. Bridges are a legal part of Bridge Foundry, Inc., a US nonprofit organization. This document outlines the support Bridge Foundry agrees to provide to leaders, and what the leader agrees to do in return. Term of Leadership Bridge Leaders commit to a one year term. One Bridge Leader takes responsibility for communications between Bridge Foundry and the Bridge leadership team, representing their Bridge on the Program Board and informing Bridge Foundry about new leaders. Bridge board members recruit new leaders regularly to create a sustainable leadership team, with mentorship from Bridge Foundry staff and volunteers as needed. Serving multiple terms is an option for Bridge leaders, though Bridge Foundry encourages turnover in this role to cultivate new leaders in your community. If we have not heard from you when your term is up,Bridge Foundry will check in with you to confirm who will be the leader for the next year, and complete an agreement with them. Bridge Foundry's Responsibilities As long as your Bridge remains active and works in a way that is consistent with our mission and policies, Bridge Foundry will: Accept online donations for the Bridge If you want to raise funds in other ways, sign up as a Volunteer Fundraiser (separate agreement) Hold funds raised for the Bridge in reserve for your Bridge\u2019s use If the Bridge becomes inactive, we may seek out new leaders. When there are no leaders for a Bridge, we reserve the right to allocate the funds to other programs to support our mission. Track financial transactions for your bridge in a location you can access to view history and bridge balance (currently via public spreadsheet) Make it easy for your bridge leaders to spend funds available by: Providing a expense card for direct purchases to one bridge leader (currently via Pex) Providing reimbursements to all bridge leaders (currently via Expensify) Facilitate access to discounts and benefits available via our non profit structure where possible This is dependent on a) what we can practically support, and b) ensuring equal access for all bridges In many cases this is as simple as providing our tax exemption letter so that a donor will make an in-kind donation or provide a discount Provide free online service, such as: Domain name registration Use of G Suite (aka Google Apps), including email addresses connected to your domain, groups, and docs Provide guidance and advice for building your community Provide guidance and support in situations where someone breaks the code of conduct or you run into other challenges Hold regular Program Board meetings, which a representative of your bridge will attend for the purpose of learning about the activities of other bridges and providing input to shape policy and influence program decisions Review contracts and agreements you want Bridge Foundry to enter for your community, determine whether it is appropriate for the organization to make the agreement, and handle signing if so. Let you know if any of these methods of support change. Bridge Leader's Responsibilities Leadership & communications By signing the Volunteer Agreement, Bridges Leaders agree to: Recruit a full board of at least three people if one is not already in place Work with their Bridge board to create a succession plan and ensure the longevity of the bridge Serve as a bridge leader for the next year (365 days after the signing of this agreement). Work with their Bridge to elect a representative to the Bridge Foundry Program Board Respond to Bridge Foundry\u2019s inquiry after a year to let us know who will be leading the bridge next year. If they don\u2019t respond and Bridge Foundry is unable to determine whether there is leadership in place, the Bridge may be moved to \u201cinactive\u201d status. Sign an agreement as a volunteer fundraiser if they want to solicit donations for their bridge (apart from having a donate button embedded on the bridge\u2019s website). Inform Bridge Foundry of any incidents of injury, harassment, or code of conduct breaches at events via the reporting form . Talk with a Bridge Foundry leader to answer questions about the incident if needed. Contact Bridge Foundry if the bridge needs something that involves signing a contract of any kind. Bridge Leaders do not have authority to bind the organization into contracts or agreements. Spending money By signing the Volunteer Agreement, Bridges Leaders agree to: Keep their expense card in a safe location and not share it with anyone else. Spend funds only on approved expense categories, according to approved expenses policy . Contact Bridge Foundry for approval, signature, and management of contract if the bridge wants to hire an independent contractor to do work for the Bridge. (Bridge Foundry will enable this option if practical given internal policies and capacity.) Submit receipts for all expense card purchases by the 5th day of the month following the month they were incurred. (currently via Expensify) Submit receipts for all expenses to be reimbursed by a month after the expense is incurred.

This policy outlines the support Bridge Foundry agrees to provide to Volunteer Fundraisers, and what the Volunteer Fundraiser agrees to do in return. This could be for a one-time fundraising effort or ongoing activity as part of a general fund-raising committee or collaboration with a Community, Chapter or Bridge. If a member of an Independent Community serves as a Volunteer Fundraiser, they are a volunteer of Bridge Foundry in this specific fundraising capacity. This agreement does not imply that their Community\u2019s activities are part of Bridge Foundry\u2019s legal operations. Volunteer Term Volunteer Fundraisers have a term of one year (365 days). If they wish to continue raising funds after a year, Bridge Foundry will ask them to complete another Volunteer Agreement. This is for multiple reasons: so that we have an accurate record of the current number of Volunteer Fundraisers with up-to-date contact information and to ensure that everyone remembers what they have agreed. Bridge Foundry's Responsibilities During your term as Volunteer Fundraiser (as long as you follow policies), Bridge Foundry will: Provide materials about Bridge Foundry that you can use in conversations with donors Answer your questions about processing donations Allocate funds you raise to the chapter, program, or purpose indicated on the volunteer agreement as long as there are active volunteers who need funding for mission-aligned activities, consistent with our operational policies. Volunteer Fundraiser's Responsibilities: By signing the Volunteer Agreement, Volunteer Fundraisers agree to: Explain to donors that donations are technically raised as \u201cunrestricted funds,\u201d which Bridge Foundry will apply for the specific purpose you\u2019re raising them for to the extent practical and that they may also be applied to other activities in support of Bridge Foundry\u2019s mission if there are leftover funds or a group of volunteers becomes inactive. (See \u201cunrestricted funds\u201d note below.) If any online fundraising component is approved for my fundraising campaign, include specific language provided by Bridge Foundry on the campaign page about the funds being unrestricted Refrain from soliciting particular donors if requested by Bridge Foundry (See \"solicitation limitations\" note below.) Gather the donor\u2019s legal name, address, and email (for companies, gather a legal company name and a contact person name) Direct donors to one of Bridge Foundry\u2019s approved online giving portals or submit an invoice request so they can pay Bridge Foundry directly. Volunteer Fundraisers may not accept cash, checks or other forms of payment directly from the donor. (See \"payment methods\" note below.) Coordinate with Bridge Foundry staff for any solicitations for Bridge Foundry general funds (vs. for a specific purpose, chapter or community) Let Bridge Foundry know if they want to raise funds using a platform, payment method or approach that is different from the primary methods the organization explicitly supports (as described in this Operations Guide). If Bridge Foundry indicates that we aren\u2019t able to support that method currently, agree not to raise funds that way. If Bridge Foundry does approve the method, communicate with Bridge Foundry staff, who will set up any required accounts. Volunteer Fundraisers do not have authority to bind the organization into agreements or open accounts in its name. Example: If I wanted to do a Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign, Bridge Foundry would need to discuss and determine whether they could support that well in advance of launching the campaign. Notes Unrestricted Funds: While most Volunteer Fundraisers step into this role to help raise money for a specific activity, chapter, community, or program, it\u2019s important for us to explain to donors that these funds are unrestricted. That\u2019s because it gives Bridge Foundry freedom to use the money as makes sense without checking back in with the donor. For example, if you have leftover money from one workshop, we can apply it to the next one. If your chapter or community becomes inactive and it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to start back up but it still has some money leftover, we have the ability to use that money to support a new group somewhere else. And, if we don\u2019t have a good reason like this to move the money around, we aren\u2019t going to. We appreciate your efforts in helping communicate this balanced view: that on the whole the money will be used for the purpose you are describing to the donor, and we may reallocate it to other mission-aligned activities under certain circumstances. Solicitation limitations: We plan in the near future to define some sponsorship guidelines, including some indicators of how to avoid partnering with companies or individuals who are not aligned with our mission. We may also coordinate centralized giving from major donors, and we may ask you to coordinate with us if you have an idea for how to engage with specific companies. These are both examples of cases in which we may, in the future, ask Volunteer Fundraisers not to solicit some donors. Payment methods: Volunteer fundraisers primarily solicit donations from corporate donors and then request that Bridge Foundry send them an invoice, which they can then pay via check, credit card, or ACH payment. If other methods of accepting funds are desired, we can discuss options, but Bridge Foundry needs to accept the donations directly. We expect acceptance of ongoing donations through a donation portal on websites to be available to Chapters soon.","title":"Volunteer fundraiser policies"},{"location":"roles/volunteer-fundraiser-policies/#volunteer-fundraiser-policies","text":"","title":"Volunteer Fundraiser Policies"},{"location":"roles/volunteer-fundraiser-policies/#definition-of-role","text":"Volunteer Fundraiser is a role that allows individuals to do fundraising for activities within Bridge Foundry\u2019s wide network of impact.

To learn more about who we are and what we do, see our website . This guide documents how we operate, providing a resource for how we work together. Mission We empower people with technology through teaching and facilitating access, enlarging the community of people who give back and teach others. Operations Bridge Foundry operates as a program of the School Factory , which is a 501c3 organization (giving us non-profit status in the USA). The Bridge Foundry work of collecting, tracking, distributing and reporting funds for all Bridges in a tax responsible way is made possible thanks to a paid part-time Bridge Foundry employee. School Factory manages our federal reporting and other administrative overhead such as reimbursements and expense tracking. Bridge Foundry volunteers and staff do work to support all of the Bridges and other programs. When we were still RailsBridge, Sarah Mei and Sarah Allen had a guiding principle for structuring the organization: \u201clet nothing stand in the way of making a workshop happen\u201d (if there is someone willing to lead it). With a much larger number of programs with a diverse and distributed community of volunteers, we've elaborated on the operational goals of the organization: Empower Individual Leaders Provide reliable, streamlined financial processing Connect people in the community who want to help Businesses that want to fund a workshop Volunteers who want to teach or start new initiatives in support of our mission Provide resources that facilitate workshops Curriculum, cookbook, code-of-conduct Support the growth of member organizations Example processes, centralized resources where helpful Bridge Foundry and all of the Bridges and their Chapters manage their funds with processes that are 100% transparent. Here is where you will find information about all of our financials and money management processes, along with operational policies. Bridge and Chapter Policies Each Bridge and each Bridge Chapter maintains full autonomy over the funds they raise (more detail on Bridge & Chapter Policies .) It is important to note that if you're just starting out a new workshop, do NOT contact Bridge Foundry. Your first point of contact should be the Bridge leader(s). If you have questions about fundraising or budgeting for your workshop, your Bridge leader(s) will point you in the right direction to get them answered. How To Bridge Foundry provides financial support in several ways. Individual volunteers or teams typically do their own fundraising for local initiatives and take advantage of Bridge Foundry 501c3 status and support systems. We do central fundraising, but often have those funds earmarked for specific purposes, so please let us know if you need funding in advance . This section contains links to information about establishing, tracking, and using funds that you raise or are raised by Bridge Foundry, which you can access by applying for a grant. Learn how to: apply for a grant for a Bridge Foundry related event, whether or not you have an established local chapter establish a fund as a new Bridge or as a new Chapter of a Bridge withdraw money for Bridge related expenses monitor your funds : the up-to-date financial information for Bridge Foundry and each Bridge entity that raises money. Sponsorship None of our organizations and initiatives could exist without the help of companies that sponsor our efforts and support us in our mission.

The Bridge Foundry work of collecting, tracking, distributing and reporting funds for all Bridges in a tax responsible way is made possible thanks to a paid part-time Bridge Foundry employee. School Factory manages our federal reporting and other administrative overhead such as reimbursements and expense tracking. Bridge Foundry volunteers and staff do work to support all of the Bridges and other programs. When we were still RailsBridge, Sarah Mei and Sarah Allen had a guiding principle for structuring the organization: \u201clet nothing stand in the way of making a workshop happen\u201d (if there is someone willing to lead it). With a much larger number of programs with a diverse and distributed community of volunteers, we've elaborated on the operational goals of the organization: Empower Individual Leaders Provide reliable, streamlined financial processing Connect people in the community who want to help Businesses that want to fund a workshop Volunteers who want to teach or start new initiatives in support of our mission Provide resources that facilitate workshops Curriculum, cookbook, code-of-conduct Support the growth of member organizations Example processes, centralized resources where helpful Bridge Foundry and all of the Bridges and their Chapters manage their funds with processes that are 100% transparent.

As a program of School Factory, Bridge Foundry and its sub-organizations must conduct activities and spend money only in support of its mission within IRS guidelines. Bridge Foundry Mission: Empower people with technology through teaching and facilitating access, enlarging the community of people who give back and teach others. Definitions Bridge Foundry (\u201cFoundry\u201d) is the support team for all the Bridges and their Chapters and free-form volunteer efforts. The Foundry is led by a Program Director and representative board. Bridge, in this document refers to a self-governing Bridge with its own board. Each bridge focuses on a specific technology, or set of technologies, and shares open source curriculum and program materials across geographies. Bridge leaders may add new Chapters and Chapter leaders. Sometimes people organize a single event or initiative for a new technology, independent of a Bridge and that is fine. Chapter: a regional, technology-specific group which has held at least one event. Each Chapter belongs to a Bridge. An active Chapter has one or more leaders, who might do fundraising and can approve expenses if the Chapter has a budget. Chapter leaders can also have the ability to approve or edit events for their chapter and add/remove leaders for their chapter. Operations Bridge Foundry is run by a small operations team, including a part time Operations Manager (operations@bridgefoundry.org) with accounting, legal, and advisory support from School Factory. New Bridges can be created by anyone who wants to offer programs that are aligned with our mission. For more detail see how to make a bridge . Event Organizing We have an open source event registration system, Bridge Troll , which has been developed by RailsBridge volunteers. While many leaders use Meetup or EventBrite to organize events, we developed Bridge Troll as a way to effectively manage separate lists of volunteers and students, allowing for ongoing profiles and tracking of history, which is not well-supported by other online tools. We strongly encourage all volunteers who are organizing events to use Bridge Troll. Please file an issue or join the mailing list if you have feedback. To learn more about it, please check out the wiki . Finance Directing Funds It is our policy that the group (Foundry, Bridge or Chapter) that raises funds, gets to direct how the funds are spent; however, donations must be provided without restriction to Bridge Foundry, so as to streamline our internal processes (more on that below). We often communicate our intentions to sponsors and report on our progress, but it is important that those reports are not a formal commitment to allocate an exact amount of money to a specific program. This allows the leadership of the Foundry, Bridge or Chapter the flexibility to reallocate funds as needed. When volunteers or staff raise funds via Bridge Foundry, they will associate the donation(s) with a specific Workshop, Chapter, Bridge, or Bridge Foundry. All funds must be spent only on educational and charitable activities that are aligned with our mission. All expenses must be approved by a Workshop or Chapter leader, a Bridge board member, or a designated volunteer or staff person. Allowed Expenses Any Bridge or Chapter will utilize funds only for charitable and educational activities consistent with our tax-exempt status described above. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Bridge will not intervene in any election or support or oppose any political party or candidate for public office, or engage in any lobbying not permitted by section 501(c)(3) of the IRC, or, if applicable, IRC 501\u00a7\u00a7(h) and 4911. Bridges or Chapters will not endorse political candidates or parties. Financial Guidance The Finance Committee is composed of staff and volunteers.

A Bridge member or workshop organizer submits an invoice request on behalf of the sponsor. Upon receiving the Bridge Foundry invoice, the sponsor submits the payment to Bridge Foundry. Bridge Foundry's bookkeeper adds the amount to the Bridge or chapter fund . For information about how a Bridge member or organizer can withdraw funds, please see our instructions for using funds .

You can: - Embed a form directly on your website, like this - Embed a button on your website that pops open the form - Request a hosted donations page if you don\u2019t have your own website For any of these options, complete the Flipcause Integration Request Form and we will send you the code to embed in your own https-enabled website (not available for custom domains via github pages, but free on Firebase hosting) and/or the link for the hosted page. Flipcause charges a fee of 4.9% + 30 cents per transaction, which they allow the donor to pay. Most donors choose to pay the fee, but if they decline to do so the amount of money you receive will be lessened by that amount. For this reason, we still recommend larger donors mail a check or you request an invoice as explained on the sponsorship page, and ask them to pay via check or ACH. Online payments using Flipcause integration are great for smaller individual donations, especially if a donor is interested in setting up a recurring payment. We will follow up with you within a week of receiving the integration request. Feel free to email finance@bridgefoundry.org if you don\u2019t hear back or have questions. Crowdfunding Campaigns We use Flipcause for crowdfunding campaigns. If you are interested in running a crowdfunding campaign, please fill out the Flipcause Integration Request Form and select the crowdfunding campaign type. We will also need the following additional information before we can launch the campaign: - A list of all the giving levels you want to use and any rewards for each one - The fair market value of each reward - All the text you want to use for the campaign description Once we receive the completed Flipcause Integration Request Form , we will follow up with you to get this additional information. Since crowdfunding campaigns have the most moving parts to setup and test, please allow at least 2 weeks to get the campaign ready for launch after you have submitted the request form. We may also need to email back and forth a few times to clarify some of the reward value details, so your responsiveness will make a difference in how quickly the campaign can launch. Before you publicize your page, please reach out to us to test it. There are a lot of small pieces of text that are in the email response and social sharing, that are hard to review until it is live. Just send a note to finance@bridgefoundry.org and we can schedule time to work together on it. We want it to work optimally for you! We will follow up with you within a week of receiving the integration request. Feel free to email finance@bridgefoundry.org if you don\u2019t receive a response within a couple of days or have questions. Paypal Donations As we transition to using Flipcause exclusively, we are continuing our support of exsiting Paypal buttons, we are not creating any new ones. Please email us at finance@bridgefoundry.org if you have questions or issues with the Paypal button on your site. Important Details About Paypal The donor can be directed to a page back on your site and that can be the home page or a thank you page. We're recommending the latter. This does not replace the Invoice request process for larger corporate sponsors who would like a tax-deductible receipt. Paypal takes 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction, so we still recommend larger donors mail a check or you request an invoice as explained on the sponsorship page, and ask them to pay via check or ACH.","title":"Online Donations"},{"location":"school-factory/sponsorship/online-donations/#online-donations","text":"If you want to accept electronic donations online, we provide a number of options for that through Flipcause. You can: - Embed a form directly on your website, like this - Embed a button on your website that pops open the form - Request a hosted donations page if you don\u2019t have your own website For any of these options, complete the Flipcause Integration Request Form and we will send you the code to embed in your own https-enabled website (not available for custom domains via github pages, but free on Firebase hosting) and/or the link for the hosted page. Flipcause charges a fee of 4.9% + 30 cents per transaction, which they allow the donor to pay. Most donors choose to pay the fee, but if they decline to do so the amount of money you receive will be lessened by that amount. For this reason, we still recommend larger donors mail a check or you request an invoice as explained on the sponsorship page, and ask them to pay via check or ACH. Online payments using Flipcause integration are great for smaller individual donations, especially if a donor is interested in setting up a recurring payment. We will follow up with you within a week of receiving the integration request.

If you are interested in running a crowdfunding campaign, please fill out the Flipcause Integration Request Form and select the crowdfunding campaign type.

Since crowdfunding campaigns have the most moving parts to setup and test, please allow at least 2 weeks to get the campaign ready for launch after you have submitted the request form. We may also need to email back and forth a few times to clarify some of the reward value details, so your responsiveness will make a difference in how quickly the campaign can launch. Before you publicize your page, please reach out to us to test it. There are a lot of small pieces of text that are in the email response and social sharing, that are hard to review until it is live. Just send a note to finance@bridgefoundry.org and we can schedule time to work together on it. We want it to work optimally for you!

General guidelines Bridges and chapters with current funding If you have collected donations and have enough to cover workshop expenses, AND you are either a Bridge or chapter leader OR have approval from one of them, you may spend your funds as you and your Bridge or chapter leader deem appropriate. In this case, you do not need pre-approval from Bridge Foundry to spend money on workshops. Bridges and chapters without current funding Bridge Foundry is committed to supporting you in putting on your workshop, so you should apply for a grant as soon as you think you might need funds. Accessing funds Whether funds for a workshop were obtained via a sponsorship or through a Bridge Foundry grant, there are multiple ways to get access to your fund. Pex Card You can use a Pex Card if you have or are eligible for one. Restrictions apply. Working with vendors You can have vendors invoice Bridge Foundry directly. In fact, it is preferred. See further instructions about working with vendors for information on how to have Bridge Foundry pay vendors directly and how to engage a vendor as a preferred vendor. Reimbursement You can request reimbursement for any and all expenses related to a workshop, including small items that volunteers pick up (e.g. name tags, muffins,) by submitting an expense report . Submitting receipts Whether funds for a workshop were obtained via a sponsorship or through a Bridge Foundry grant, or if the funds have already been disbursed or you need a reimbursement, receipts must be submitted within 7 days of the workshop. There are some important guidelines for you to keep in mind as you get and save receipts: Save and submit itemized receipts . If you also have a copy that shows the tip amount paid, submit both versions together. Receipts should indicate that payment was received . So an invoice that shows an amount due doesn't work.

Our goal is to make this easy for volunteers. If any of this presents a hardship, please let us know ! We're always looking for ways to streamline our processes. Get Set Up On Expensify Complete and submit this form: http://goo.gl/forms/7PjAqgoGM2. Once you have received an email from Expensify notifying you that you have been added to the \u201cBridge Foundry Policy\u201d, create an account on Expensify and submit your report. You should be set up within one business day. If you do not receive an Expensify confirmation that you have been added to the \u201cBridge Foundry Policy\u201d within that time frame, please email finance@bridgefoundry.org. \u200bYou can sign in with an existing account like Google or set up a username and password. Add your bank account (do this before submitting your report to get paid faster!) The bank account information should belong to the individual who is requesting reimbursement -- or who you would like the reimbursement to go to. Your chapter does not need a bank account to do this, but any organizer who wants to be reimbursed does. For your protection, we recommend that individuals sign up for their own account and enter their own bank information. Click on the icon in the upper right corner of the screen and select \"Personal Settings\". On the right side of the screen, select \"Reimbursement\", then add a deposit account. You will need your routing and account numbers. Once the account is added, Expensify will make three deposits into your account that you will need to verify in order to receive reimbursement via the account. Report Submission Requirements When submitting reports, the following must be included to receive reimbursement: For workshop expenses, include the date(s) of the workshop in the report name. Select an expense category and a tag (your chapter name or general fund) for each individual expense. List specifics in the Comment field for expenses in the Other category. All expenses must have itemized receipts attached. (Include both itemized receipt and payment receipt if tips included in final total. Use our template for on-site service providers if they don't provide receipts.) Invoices that don't list an amount paid do not count as receipts. We need to see that you paid the invoice. Expenses must be for a chapter or fund you are approved to submit expenses for, and must follow our allowed expense guidelines. You must have a bank account set up with Expensify (or PayPal outside of the US). To Submit Expenses for Reimbursement Create a new report and add all expenses to be reimbursed, following all the guidelines under \u201crequirements\u201d above. See examples in screen shot below: Submit the report using the button near the top left of the screen. If you haven\u2019t already, add a bank account so you can receive payment. You will receive an email when the expense report has been approved. Feel free to email us at finance@bridgefoundry.org if you aren\u2019t seeing approval come through within a week of submission. If you haven\u2019t added a bank account yet when the report is approved, Expensify will send you an email asking you to add an account. You won\u2019t get paid until you have added an account. PLEASE NOTE that if you DO NOT select the \"Bridge Foundry\" policy in the upper right hand corner of the report, it won't be submitted to us and we will not receive notification that you've submitted a report. ACH payments will generally be processed on Mondays and will arrive in your bank account about one week later. To prevent delay of your reimbursement, please ensure your bank account information is included on your login. To Submit a Report to Reimburse Someone Else Since ACH is the fastest way to get reimbursed via Expensify's secure system, we encourage each volunteer to submit their own reports and bank information.

Our goal is to make this easy for volunteers. If any of this presents a hardship, please let us know ! We're always looking for ways to streamline our processes. In addition to following the directions below for getting set up on Expensify initially, we encourage you to bookmark this page and review the \"Submitting Reports\" section each time you submit a report, as there are important reminders included. Get Set Up On Expensify (One time) Complete and submit this form . Once you have received an email from Expensify notifying you that you have been added to the \u201cBridge Foundry Policy,\u201d create an account on Expensify. You can sign in with an existing account like Google or set up a username and password. (You should be set up within two business days. If you do not receive an Expensify confirmation that you have been added to the \u201cBridge Foundry Policy\u201d within that time frame, please email finance@bridgefoundry.org.) If you are getting reimbursed, add your bank account (do this before submitting your report to get paid faster!) The bank account information should belong to the individual who is requesting reimbursement. Each individual that needs reimbursement generally signs up for their own account and enters their own bank information. If you need to submit a report on someone else's behalf, however, see the instructions at the bottom of this page. Here's how to add the bank account for your own reimbursements: Click on the icon in the upper right corner of the screen and select \"Personal Settings\". On the right side of the screen, select \"Reimbursement\", then add a deposit account. You will need your routing and account numbers. Once the account is added, Expensify will make three deposits into your account that you will need to verify in order to receive reimbursement via the account. Submitting Reports Create a new report and add your expenses: For workshop expenses, include the date(s) of the workshop in the report name. Check the \"reimburseable\" box on each expense that you paid out of pocket and uncheck the box for Pex card expenses. Select an expense category and a tag (your chapter/community name or general fund) for each individual expense. List specifics in the Comment field for expenses in the Other category. Double check that your report meets the following criteria - these are required for reimbursement! All expenses must have itemized receipts attached. (Include both itemized receipt and payment receipt if tips included in final total. Invoices that don't list an amount paid do not count as receipts. We need to see that you paid the invoice. Use our template for on-site service providers if they don't provide receipts.) See note at the bottom of this page about how to submit multiple receipts! Expenses must be for a chapter or fund for which you are approved to submit expenses, and must follow our approved expenses policy Submit the report using the button near the top left of the screen. If you haven\u2019t already, add a bank account so you can receive payment. (For those getting reimbursed.) You will receive an email when the expense report has been approved. Feel free to email us at finance@bridgefoundry.org if you aren\u2019t seeing approval come through within a week of submission. PLEASE NOTE that if you DO NOT select the \"Bridge Foundry\" policy in the upper right hand corner of the report, it won't be submitted to us and we will not receive notification that you've submitted a report. For those getting reimbursed, ACH payments will arrive in your bank account about one week after approval. Attaching Multiple Receipts For expenses that require multiple attachments, there are two ways to approach this: Combine all receipts for that expense into a single document and then upload that for the receipt. We will scroll through when reviewing the receipts. Or, include additional receipts/documents at the bottom of the report as \"attachments.\" If it looks like something is missing, we will check the attachments before asking you about it.

Each card costs us $7.50/month, so we need to reserve these cards for active Chapters and Bridges. Signing an agreement as a Chapter Leader or Bridge Leader qualifies you for a Pex card, and we ask that if you only expect to charge expenses to it very rarely, you consider doing reimbursements or direct pay instead so we can keep these maintenance fees lower. Application Process Complete the PEX Card Application & Agreement form. Be prepared to provide the following information: Your First and Last Name Address Date of Birth Phone number How soon you will need the card It takes about a month for you to receive your card after submitting the application, so plan ahead!
